'Just been watching the game , did you miss the coach ? # RubberDub # 7minutes , ' Merson put on Twitter . Merson initially angered Townsend for writing in his Sky Sports column that 'if Andros Townsend can get in ( the England team ) then it opens it up to anybody . ' Paul Merson had another dig at Andros Townsend after his appearance for Tottenham against Burnley Townsend was brought on in the 83rd minute for Tottenham as they drew 0-0 against Burnley Andros Townsend scores England 's equaliser in their 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday night The former Arsenal man was proven wrong when Townsend hit a stunning equaliser for England against Italy and he duly admitted his mistake . 'It 's not as though I was watching hoping he would n't score for England , I 'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him â€“ it was a great goal , ' Merson said . 'It 's just a matter of opinion , and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson , so he should n't have been in the squad . 'When I 'm wrong , I hold my hands up . I do n't have a problem with doing that - I 'll always be the first to admit when I 'm wrong . ' Townsend hit back at Merson on Twitter after scoring for England against Italy Sky Sports pundit Merson ( centre ) criticised Townsend 's call-up to the England squad last week Townsend hit back at Merson after netting for England in Turin on Wednesday , saying 'Not bad for a player that should be 'nowhere near the squad ' ay @ PaulMerse ? ' Any bad feeling between the pair seemed to have passed but Merson was unable to resist having another dig at Townsend after Tottenham drew at Turf Moor .",
